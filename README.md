# datamining_project
We aimed to analyze the changes in the World Happiness Index of countries from 2024 to 2025, exploring factors behind high and low rankings.

Nordic countries like Finland, Norway, and Denmark consistently ranked high in happiness scores, while countries such as Afghanistan and Syria were at the bottom. There were noticeable regional differences and some countries showed score fluctuations between the two years.

Our analysis, relying on visualizations like maps and bar charts along with basic statistical comparisons, effectively presented the happiness index trends. It provided a clear picture of global happiness disparities and trends over the two - year period.

Incorporating more detailed and real - time data on emerging factors like digital well - being and environmental sustainability could enhance the analysis. Also, using more advanced statistical models for deeper insights into the relationships between contributing factors and happiness scores would be beneficial.
